# MicrosoftPowerApps_DemoData

Data for automation and image processing. It includes the data I used for training to build a PowerApp. The same datatsets and images are available at Coursera as well.

While working on my PowerApp, I also built basics apps titled 'Help Desk', 'Class Tracker' and 'Site Inspection'.

1. Help Desk PowerApp lets employees in an organization issue electronics such as laptops, chargers, etc. It is like a library for electronics so it includes functionalities such as updating information about the status of devices, issue date, problems with the device, etc.

   The following images are a snapshot of my app showcasing the general login for help desk user/admin, interface for generating tickets or logging out, and creating a ticket:

2. Site Inspection PowerApp lets users inspect a location, add/delete/edit locations, search neaby sites and provides details about the existing sites.
