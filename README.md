# MicrosoftPowerApps_DemoData

Data for automation and image processing. It includes the data I used for training to build a PowerApp. The same datatsets and images are available at Coursera as well.

While working on my PowerApp, I also built basics apps titled 'Help Desk', 'Class Tracker' and 'Site Inspection'.

1. Help Desk PowerApp lets employees in an organization issue electronics such as laptops, chargers, etc. It is like a library for electronics so it includes functionalities like updating information about the status of devices, issue date, problems with the device, etc.
